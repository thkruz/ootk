> An Orbital Object Toolkit in Your Web Browser

**ootk** is a collection libraries for doing math related to orbital objects written in TypeScript. **ootk** was
developed to simplify the math and let you focus on using the results.

Most of the functionality was originally written for [KeepTrack](https://github.com/thkruz/keeptrack.space) and then
later refactored into this library for others to use.

## :wrench: Installation

Install the library with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm i ootk
```

### Loading the Library

```js
import { Sgp4, Satellite } from 'ootk';
...
const satrec = Sgp4.createSatrec(line1, line2, 'wgs72', 'i');
```

## :satellite: Usage

### Propagating a TLE

```js
const satrec = Sgp4.createSatrec(line1, line2);
const state = Sgp4.propagate(satrec, time);
console.log(state.position); // [x, y, z]
console.log(state.velocity); // [vx, vy, vz]
```

### Creating a Satellite

```js
const sat = new Satellite({ name: 'Test', tle1, tle2 });
console.log(sat.intlDes); // International Designator
console.log(sat.epochYear); // Epoch Year
console.log(sat.epochDay); // Epoch Day
console.log(sat.meanMoDev1); // Mean Motion Deviation 1
console.log(sat.meanMoDev2); // Mean Motion Deviation 2
console.log(sat.bstar); // Bstar (Drag Coefficient)
console.log(sat.inclination); // inclination in degrees
console.log(sat.raan); // right ascension of the ascending node in degrees
console.log(sat.eccentricity); // eccentricity
console.log(sat.argOfPerigee); // argument of perigee in degrees
console.log(sat.meanAnomaly); // mean anomaly in degrees
console.log(sat.meanMotion); // mean motion in revolutions per day
console.log(sat.period); // period in seconds
console.log(sat.apogee); // apogee in kilometers
console.log(sat.perigee); // perigee in kilometers

sat.propagate(time); // Propagate the satellite to the given time
sat.getLla(); // Get the satellite's position in latitude, longitude, altitude at its current time
sat.getEci(time); // Get the satellite's position in Earth-Centered Inertial coordinates at the given time without changing its state
sat.getRae(sensor, time); // Get position in range, aziimuth, elevation relative to a sensor object at the given time without changing its state
```

### Creating a Sensor

```js
const sensor = new Ootk.Sensor({ name: 'Test', lat: lat, lon: lon, alt: alt });
sensor.setTime(time); // Set the sensor's time to the given time
sensor.getRae(sat); // Get satellite position in range, aziimuth, elevation at the sensor's current time
sensor.getRae(sat, time); // Get position in range, aziimuth, elevation relative to a satellite object at the given time without changing its state
```

## :desktop_computer: Building

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/);

2. Install all required packages with NPM by running the following command from repository's root directory:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the following NPM script to build everything:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## :gem: NPM Scripts

- `build` compiles TypeScript into ES6 Modules and combines them into a single file in the `dist` directory.
- `lint` lints source code located in `src` directory with [ESLint](http://eslint.org/)
- `lint:fix` lints tests located in `src` directory with ESLint and attempts to auto-fix errors
- `lint:test` lints tests located in `test` directory with ESLint
- `test` runs jest to verify code remains functional
- `test:coverage` generates lcov report to view code coverage
