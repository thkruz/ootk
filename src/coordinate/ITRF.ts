 * The International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) is a geocentric reference frame for the Earth. It is the

 * different epoch, to address the issue of crustal motion. The latest version is ITRF2014, based on data collected from
 * 1980 to 2014.

 * This is a geocentric coordinate system, also referenced as ECF/ECEF (Earth Centered Earth Fixed). It is a Cartesian
 * coordinate system with the origin at the center of the Earth. The x-axis intersects the sphere of the Earth at 0°
 * latitude (the equator) and 0° longitude (the Prime Meridian). The z-axis goes through the North Pole. The y-axis goes
 * through 90° East longitude.
